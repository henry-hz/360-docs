## 7. Ownership and License

### 7.1 Provider Materials
Provider retains all rights to pre-existing tools, libraries, and know-how ("Background IP").

### 7.2 Work Product
Upon full payment, Provider grants Client all rights, title, and interests in and to the work product created specifically for Client as part of this Agreement (including intellectual property rights), and Client will be the sole owner of it. Work product includes the finished product, as well as drafts, notes, materials, mockups, hardware, designs, inventions, patents, code, and anything else that Provider works on as specified in Exhibit A — that is, conceives, creates, designs, develops, invents, works on, or reduces to practice — as part of this project, whether before the date of this Agreement or after.

### 7.3 Provider's Use of Work Product
Once Provider gives the work product to Client, Provider does not have any rights to it, except those that Client explicitly gives Provider in this Agreement.

### 7.4 Background IP License
Provider is giving Client a right to use and license (with the right to sublicense) the Background IP to develop, market, sell, and support Client's products and services. Client may use this Background IP worldwide and free of charge, but it cannot transfer its rights to the Background IP (except as allowed in Section 16 (Assignment)). Client cannot sell or license the Background IP separately from its products or services.

### 7.5 Client IP
Provider may need to use Client's intellectual property to perform the Services. Client agrees to let Provider use Client's intellectual property and other intellectual property that Client controls to the extent reasonably necessary to perform the Services. Beyond that, Client is not giving Provider any intellectual property rights, unless specifically stated otherwise in this Agreement.

### 7.6 Other Projects
If Provider is simultaneously engaged in other projects not related to Client, it is explicitly agreed that nothing in this Agreement should be construed as giving Client any IP or other rights in those other projects and Client waives any such claims.

### 7.7 Provider's Help Securing Ownership
In the future, Client may need Provider's help to show that Client owns the work product or to complete the transfer. Provider agrees to help with that. For example, Provider may have to sign a patent application. Client will pay any required expenses for this. If Client can't find Provider after spending reasonable effort trying to do so, Provider hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Client as Provider's agent and attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with an interest, to act for Provider and on Provider's behalf to execute, verify, and file the required documents and to take any other legal action to accomplish the purposes of paragraph 7.2 (Work Product).
