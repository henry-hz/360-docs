# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT - SCOPE OF WORK [draft]

## PHASED DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

### Phase 1: Prototype Development (No-Code/Low-Code)
**Duration:** 10 hours
**Rate:** $180 USD/hour
**Total:** $1,800 USD

**Deliverables:**
- Initial application prototype using Airtable and third-party online tools
- Basic functionality covering approximately 70% of business requirements
- Architecture documentation and technical feasibility assessment

**Rationale:** Given the inherent volatility in early-stage software development where structural design decisions may significantly impact the entire system, the initial phase will utilize rapid prototyping tools to validate requirements and minimize risk.

### Phase 2: Integration Development
**Estimated Cost Range:** $5,000 - $15,000 USD
**Trigger:** Upon prototype validation and client approval to proceed with production integrations
**Estimated Duration:** 25 business days
**Scope:**
- Custom ClickSign integration development
- WhatsApp integration via N8n or make platform
- Celcoin payment integration

**Implementation Strategy:** Contractor will develop custom integrations for ClickSign while leveraging business-friendly automation tools (N8n) for WhatsApp connectivity to optimize cost and maintainability.

### Phase 3: Production Application (If Required)
**Trigger:** When scope volatility stabilizes, product requirements are clearly defined, and scalability needs arise.

**Options:**
1. Enhanced Airtable implementation with paid enterprise features
2. Custom React-based frontend with dedicated backend infrastructure

**Additional Considerations:**
- Backend/frontend architecture incurs higher costs for development, debugging, deployment, and ongoing team maintenance
- Client learning curve investment will directly impact long-term operational costs
- Contractor will provide close project supervision with option to scale to full-time engagement based on business growth

**Team Requirements & Monthly Costs:**
- 1-2 senior developers (on-site or dedicated remote): $2,500 - $5,000/month
- Customer support specialist: $800 - $1,500/month
- DevOps engineer (part-time or fractional): $1,500 - $2,500/month
- Technical supervision (8 hours/month at $180/hour): $1,440/month
- Infrastructure and tools: $300 - $800/month

**Estimated Monthly Operating Cost:** $6,540 - $11,240 USD
